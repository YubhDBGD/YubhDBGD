### üèóÔ∏è Current projects

#### Artlist
This is a personal project that is very close to my heart. As a classically trained musician, I am passionate about making fine art events more accessible to everyone.  
I am creating this web application aimed to showcase upcoming fine art events in the Greater Toronto Area. Artlist will allow users to easily browse events happening near them within the next few days and see the distance from their location.  
My goal is to make it easy for anyone to discover and connect with their community through art.

#### Dirigierakademie 
Dirigierakademie is an organization created by conductors Matthew Lynch and myself. We aim to create workshops that connect professional orchestras to early career conductors, in a friendly and educational environment.  
Currently the website is created through squarespace, but I intent to create a brand new website with form and payment feature. I will also use this opportunity to familiarize myself with another framework.
